I’m interested in Turkic languages and have recently decided to study Old Turkic. Instead of memorizing the script or installing a specialized keyboard, I decided to create a simple conversion webpage to convert between Turkic script and Latin script. In the future, I plan to add support for converting other scripts, such as the old Uyghur script etc.
